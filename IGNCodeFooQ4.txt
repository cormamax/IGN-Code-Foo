I would really like to work for IGN. I have been a reader of the site for several years. I can remember listening to the Nintendo Wiik in Review with Matt, Bozon, Daemon, and Craig.


Like I said in my quick bio, I’m a computer science major. I’d like to make video games. If I got this internship, it would not just be an internship for me. It would help me learn about other sides of the game industry, and be apart of a wonderful company. 


I’m not someone who thinks they know everything, but I do consider myself a fast learner. I’m a leader and role model where I work, and know that I can help contribute and bring new ideas to IGN.
