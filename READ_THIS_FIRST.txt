My name is Max Corman. I am studing computer science at
the University of Michigan. I will be entering my third year
this fall. My GPA is 3.352 and my cumlative GPA is 3.458.
I know C++ and am currently in the process of learning the
Android platform. I consider myself a gamer, but find it hard
to find the time to play all the games I want to while at 
college.

My teammates and I have created MathBlast, an educational 
video game, as part of one of my classes. The best way to 
describe it would be to call it Bust-A-Move, but instead 
of matching three bubbles of the same color, you form 
addition and subtration equations. The game is currently 
used in that class as a sample game for incoming students 
to look at.

During the summers, I work at my summer camp, Tamarack 
Camps. I have been a counselor there for 3 years, and this
year have been hired on as a clinic assistant. During the 
school year, I work as a Building Supervisor at my school's
rec building. While working here I am in charge of the
building and student employees.

The titles of the files that hold my answers are below.
I pushed everything in my folder to github, so all my 
work is there, even if it isn't used in my final answer.
